1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
*
'hello'
-87.8
-
/
+
6

Ans1.
Expressions:
*
-
/
+

Values:
'hello'
-87.8
6



2. What is the difference between string and variable?

Ans2.
String: 
String is a data type which is indicated by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
eg: 'hello' and "hello" both are strings, even '123' this is considered a string.

Varriable:
Varriable are use to store data, that data may be of any type either string or integer or anything else.
we can assign string to a varriable
                                   x = 'hello'
here 'hello' is a string whis is assigned to varriable x.





3. Describe three different data types.
Ans3.
Integer:
This value is represented by int class. It contains positive or negative whole numbers without fraction or decimal point.
eg:
       x = 25 and x = -25
       
Floats:
Floats are real numbers with decimal point.
eg:
       x = 20.0 and x = -20.35
       
String:
A string is a sequences of character, indicated by single or double quotation marks.
eg:
          x = 'hello'
      



4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
Ans4.
A combination of operands and operators is called an expression. The expression in Python produces some value or result after being interpreted by the Python interpreter.
An example of expression can be :
                              x = x + 1 0



5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
expression and a statement?
Ans5.
The expression in Python produces some value or result after being interpreted by the Python interpreter. An expression is very different from statements in Python. A statement is not evaluated for some results. A statement is used for creating variables or for displaying values.
eg:
     spam = 10, it is statemnent
     spam = sapm + 10, it is an expression



6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1
Ans6.
The variable bacon still contains 22 because the bacon + 1 expression does not reassign. 



7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam' 
'spam'*3
Ans7. 'spamspamspam' and 'spamspamspam'



8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
Ans8.
eggs and 100 both are varriable name so they are identifiers and indetifiers cannot starts with a digit, They must start with a letter or the underscore character.



9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
version of a value?
Ans9.
Three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, and string version of a value are-
int()
float()
str()



10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'
Ans10.
This Expression cause an error because we try to concatenate string with a integer.
Correct expression is
             'I have eaten ' + '99' + ' burritos.'
         or, 'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'
